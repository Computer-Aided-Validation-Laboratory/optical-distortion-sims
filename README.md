# Influence of Optical Distortions on the Uncertainty of Digital Image Correlation Measurements

Repository for the code and images produced for the above titled final year project. 

This project looks into simulating the effect of optical distortion on digital image correlation.
The specific application of this is viewports deforming under vacuum conditions. 
This effect will be simulated using pyvale's Blender module, and then compared to experimental images
